# CS-211-Maze-Program
This program takes a text file that lists the dimensions of the maze, the start position, the end position, and any blocked positions
that cannot be moved through (in that order). Errors are given for incorrect coordinates, and then the maze is displayed. The program
then looks for a path from the start ("s") to the end ("e"), and lists the moves made to get to the end, or states that it is impossible
